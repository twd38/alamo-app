# MES Design Learnings: From Part-Centric to Operation-Based Manufacturing

## Overview

This document captures key learnings from designing a modern MRP/MES system, transitioning from a rigid part-centric model to a flexible, operation-based architecture that mirrors industry best practices.

## Core Learning 1: Procedures Should Be Decoupled from Parts

### The Problem
Initially, work instructions were directly tied to parts in a 1:1 relationship. This created significant duplication - if 50 different brackets needed similar deburring instructions, we'd write the same procedure 50 times.

### The Solution: Reusable Procedures Library
Creating a separate procedures table enables:
- **Reusability**: One "Surface Treatment Procedure" can be used by hundreds of parts
- **Version Control**: Update a procedure once, affects all parts using it
- **Categorization**: Organize by type (assembly, inspection, finishing)
- **Flexibility**: Parts can reference multiple procedures in sequence

### Key Insight
*Manufacturing procedures are assets, not attributes of parts.*

## Core Learning 2: Operations vs Procedures vs Work Instructions

### Understanding the Hierarchy
Through research of industry systems (SAP, Oracle), we discovered these are related but distinct concepts:

**Operations**
- Atomic, schedulable units of work
- Performed at specific work centers
- Have measurable time/cost
- Example: "Drill hole" (30 min at CNC-01)

**Procedures**
- Detailed HOW-TO instructions
- Can span multiple operations
- Documentation-focused
- Example: 10-page document with safety steps, parameters

**Work Instructions**
- Step-by-step operator guidance
- Very specific and tactical
- Example: "Set dial to 5, press green button for 3 seconds"

### Key Insight
*Most modern systems use "Operations" as the schedulable unit and attach detailed procedures to them.*

## Core Learning 3: The Power of Routing

### What We Discovered
Industry-standard MES systems don't link operations directly to parts. Instead, they use:

```
Parts ‚Üí Routings ‚Üí Operations ‚Üí Work Centers
```

### Why This Matters
1. **Multiple Paths**: Same part can have different manufacturing methods
   - Standard routing: Full process
   - Rush routing: Skip non-critical steps
   - Low-volume routing: Manual processes

2. **Flexibility**: 50 different brackets might share 3 routing templates

3. **Optimization**: Can analyze and improve entire process flows

### Key Insight
*Routing is the recipe; operations are the ingredients.*

## Core Learning 4: Batch Production Requires Special Handling

### The Challenge
"What if 3 different brackets are cut from the same steel sheet?"

### The Solution: Nest Patterns
We learned that batch/nested production needs:
1. **Nest Patterns**: Define how multiple parts fit on one sheet
2. **Production Batches**: Group work orders that share operations
3. **Shared vs Individual Operations**: Some operations apply to the batch, others to individual parts

### Real-World Application
```
Batch Operation: Laser cutting (all parts together)
    ‚Üì
Individual Operations: Each part's subsequent processing
```

### Key Insight
*Not all manufacturing fits the "one part, one process" model. Design for reality.*

## Core Learning 5: Work Readiness is Complex

### The Problem
Workers need to know WHEN they can start work, not just WHAT work exists.

### Dependencies We Discovered
1. **Operation Sequence**: Previous operations must complete
2. **Batch Dependencies**: Waiting for shared operations
3. **Material Availability**: Parts/materials must be staged
4. **Resource Constraints**: Tools, fixtures must be available

### The Solution
Real-time readiness calculation with clear blocking reasons:
- ‚úÖ Ready: Can start immediately
- üö´ Blocked: Shows specific reason
- ‚è≥ Pending: Estimated ready time

### Key Insight
*MES isn't just about tracking work; it's about orchestrating it.*

## Core Learning 6: Data Model Evolution Strategy

### Migration Principles
1. **Never Break Existing Functionality**: Add new tables alongside old
2. **Preserve All Data**: Migration scripts, not deletions
3. **Phased Approach**: Small, testable changes
4. **Maintain APIs**: Compatibility layers during transition

### Implementation Phases
1. Foundation (new tables)
2. Migration scripts
3. Parallel running
4. Cutover
5. Cleanup

### Key Insight
*Evolution, not revolution. Users shouldn't experience disruption.*

## Core Learning 7: Industry Standards Exist for Good Reasons

### What We Found
Every major MRP/MES system uses similar patterns:
- SAP: Work Centers ‚Üí Operations ‚Üí Routings
- Oracle: Resources ‚Üí Standard Operations ‚Üí Routings
- Microsoft Dynamics: Same pattern

### Why Convergence Happens
These patterns solve universal manufacturing problems:
- Resource scheduling
- Cost tracking
- Process optimization
- Quality control
- Capacity planning

### Key Insight
*Don't reinvent the wheel. Learn from decades of manufacturing software evolution.*

## Practical Takeaways

### For Schema Design
1. **Separate Concerns**: Operations, procedures, and routings are different entities
2. **Plan for Reuse**: Most manufacturing has repetitive elements
3. **Design for Reality**: Include batch production, dependencies, variants
4. **Version Everything**: Procedures, routings, and operations change over time

### For Implementation
1. **Start with Core Concepts**: Work centers, operations, simple routings
2. **Add Complexity Gradually**: Batching, dependencies, advanced scheduling
3. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: During transition
4. **Focus on User Workflows**: Design from the operator's perspective

### For the Business
1. **Standardization Saves Time**: Reusable operations reduce setup
2. **Flexibility Enables Growth**: Multiple routings support different scenarios
3. **Visibility Drives Efficiency**: Real-time status prevents confusion
4. **Data Enables Optimization**: Structured data reveals improvement opportunities

## Conclusion

The journey from a part-centric to an operation-based MES revealed that manufacturing software patterns have evolved to solve real problems. By adopting industry-standard approaches while accommodating unique needs (like nested production), we can build a system that's both powerful and practical.

The key is understanding that modern MES is about:
- **Reusability** over duplication
- **Flexibility** over rigid structures
- **Visibility** over assumptions
- **Standards** over custom solutions

These learnings form the foundation for building a manufacturing execution system that can grow with the business while maintaining operational efficiency.
