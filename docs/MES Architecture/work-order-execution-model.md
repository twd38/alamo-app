# Work Order Execution Model: Instructions vs Operations

## The Critical Question

**Is a work order executed with Work Instructions OR by Operations + Procedures?**

## The Answer: It Depends on the Evolution Phase

### Current State (Pre-MES Evolution)

Work Orders are executed with **Work Instructions**

### Target State (Post-MES Evolution)

Work Orders will be executed through **Routings ‚Üí Operations ‚Üí Procedures**

Let me explain both models and why this transition is happening:

---

## Model 1: Current State - Work Instruction Based (Active Now)

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Current Execution Model"
        WO[Work Order]
        WOWI[Work Order Work Instructions<br/>Snapshot Copy]
        WI[Work Instructions<br/>Part-specific steps]
        EXEC[Operator Executes]
    end

    WO -->|creates snapshot| WOWI
    WI -->|copied to| WOWI
    WOWI -->|guides| EXEC

    style WO fill:#e8f5e9
    style WOWI fill:#fff3e0
    style WI fill:#e3f2fd
```

### How It Works Now:

1. **Work Order Created** for Part X, Quantity 100
2. **Work Instructions Copied** - System creates `WorkOrderWorkInstruction` (snapshot)
3. **Operator Follows** the copied instructions step-by-step
4. **Direct Execution** - No routing or operations involved

### Current Database Structure:

```typescript
WorkOrder {
  id: "WO-001"
  partId: "PART-123"
  workInstruction: WorkOrderWorkInstruction {
    // This is a SNAPSHOT of the instructions
    steps: [
      {
        title: "Setup machine"
        instructions: "Load fixture A..."
        actions: [checkboxes, measurements]
      },
      {
        title: "Run program"
        instructions: "Select program P123..."
        actions: [value inputs, sign-offs]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Pros of Current Model:

- ‚úÖ Simple and straightforward
- ‚úÖ All instructions in one place
- ‚úÖ Easy for operators to follow
- ‚úÖ Good for low-volume, high-mix production

### Cons of Current Model:

- ‚ùå Instructions duplicated for every similar part
- ‚ùå No resource scheduling (which machine?)
- ‚ùå Can't optimize across work centers
- ‚ùå Limited reusability

## Model 2: Target State - Operation Based (MES Evolution Goal)

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Target Execution Model"
        WO[Work Order]
        RT[Selected Routing]
        RS[Routing Steps<br/>Sequence]
        OP[Operations<br/>Reusable]
        PROC[Procedures<br/>Detailed How-To]
        WC[Work Centers<br/>Where]
        EXEC[Operator Executes]
    end

    WO -->|selects| RT
    RT -->|contains| RS
    RS -->|references| OP
    RS -->|assigns to| WC
    OP -->|documented by| PROC
    PROC -->|guides| EXEC
    WC -->|hosts| EXEC

    style WO fill:#000
    style RT fill:#000
    style OP fill:#000
    style PROC fill:#000
    style WC fill:#000
```

### How It Will Work:

1. **Work Order Created** for Part X, Quantity 100
2. **Routing Selected** (e.g., Standard, Rush, or Alternate)
3. **Operations Scheduled** at specific Work Centers
4. **Procedures Guide** the operator through each Operation
5. **Execution Tracked** at the Operation level

### Future Database Structure:

```typescript
WorkOrder {
  id: "WO-001"
  partId: "PART-123"
  routingId: "ROUTING-STD-001"  // Selected routing

  // Execution tracked through routing steps
  currentOperation: "OP-DRILL-200"
  currentWorkCenter: "CNC-01"

  operationStatus: [
    { operationId: "OP-CUT-100", status: "COMPLETED", actualTime: 45 },
    { operationId: "OP-DRILL-200", status: "IN_PROGRESS", actualTime: 20 },
    { operationId: "OP-DEBURR-300", status: "PENDING", actualTime: 0 }
  ]
}
```

### Pros of Target Model:

- ‚úÖ Highly reusable operations
- ‚úÖ Resource scheduling and optimization
- ‚úÖ Standard times and costs
- ‚úÖ Better capacity planning
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard approach

### Cons of Target Model:

- ‚ùå More complex setup
- ‚ùå Requires training
- ‚ùå Migration effort needed

## The Hybrid Reality During Transition

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Transition Period - Hybrid Model"
        WO[Work Order]

        subgraph "Path A: Legacy Parts"
            WI[Work Instructions]
            WOWI[Snapshot Instructions]
        end

        subgraph "Path B: New Parts"
            RT[Routing]
            OP[Operations]
            PROC[Procedures]
        end

        EXEC[Operator Interface]
    end

    WO -->|legacy| WI
    WI --> WOWI
    WOWI --> EXEC

    WO -->|new| RT
    RT --> OP
    OP --> PROC
    PROC --> EXEC

    style WO fill:#e8f5e9
    style WI fill:#ffccbc
    style RT fill:#c8e6c9
```

During the transition, Alamo will support BOTH models:

- **Existing parts** continue using Work Instructions
- **New parts** use the Routing/Operations model
- **Gradual migration** of existing parts to new model

## Detailed Execution Comparison

### Scenario: Manufacturing 50 Brackets

#### Current Model (Work Instructions):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Work Order Execution"
        Start[WO-001: 50 Brackets]
        Copy[Copy Work Instructions<br/>10 detailed steps]
        Step1[Operator follows Step 1:<br/>'Setup CNC machine...']
        Step2[Operator follows Step 2:<br/>'Load material...']
        Step3[Continue through<br/>all 10 steps]
        Complete[50 Brackets Done]
    end

    Start --> Copy
    Copy --> Step1
    Step1 --> Step2
    Step2 --> Step3
    Step3 --> Complete
```

**What the operator sees:**

```
Work Order: WO-001

Instructions:
  Step 1: Setup CNC machine
    - Load fixture A into position
    - Install tool set B
    - Run warmup cycle
    [‚úì] Check: Fixture secured

  Step 2: Load material
    - Place aluminum sheet on bed
    - Align to stops
    [üìè] Measure: Material thickness

  Step 3-10: [More detailed steps...]
```

#### Target Model (Operations + Procedures):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Work Order Execution"
        Start[WO-001: 50 Brackets]

## Why the Evolution Matters

### The Problem with Work Instructions Only:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Duplication Problem"
        P1[Bracket Type A<br/>Work Instructions:<br/>20 steps]
        P2[Bracket Type B<br/>Work Instructions:<br/>20 steps<br/>18 are identical!]
        P3[Bracket Type C<br/>Work Instructions:<br/>20 steps<br/>18 are identical!]
    end

    subgraph "Maintenance Nightmare"
        Change[Change drilling<br/>parameters]
        U1[Update Part A instructions]
        U2[Update Part B instructions]
        U3[Update Part C instructions]
    end

    Change --> U1
    Change --> U2
    Change --> U3

    style Change fill:#ffccbc
```

### The Solution with Operations:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Reusability Solution"
        OP[Operation: DRILL-200<br/>Drill 4 holes<br/>One procedure]
        P1[Bracket Type A<br/>Uses DRILL-200]
        P2[Bracket Type B<br/>Uses DRILL-200]
        P3[Bracket Type C<br/>Uses DRILL-200]
    end

    subgraph "Single Update"
        Change[Change drilling<br/>parameters]
        Update[Update DRILL-200<br/>procedure once]
    end

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Current Reality**

- Work Orders execute with **Work Instructions** (part-specific, detailed steps)
- Simple but not scalable
- Each part has its own complete set of instructions

### 2. **Future Vision**

- Work Orders will execute through **Routings ‚Üí Operations ‚Üí Procedures**
- Operations are reusable across many parts
- Work Centers provide resource scheduling
- Industry-standard approach

### 3. **The Transition**

- Both models will coexist during migration
- New parts use the new model
- Existing parts gradually converted
- No disruption to production

### 4. **Why It Matters**

- **Efficiency**: Write procedures once, use everywhere
- **Scheduling**: Know which work center is doing what
- **Optimization**: Balance load across resources
- **Maintenance**: Update in one place, affects all parts
- **Scalability**: Add new parts quickly by reusing operations

### 5. **For Operators**

The interface remains similar - they still see step-by-step instructions. The difference is WHERE those instructions come from:

- **Now**: From part-specific work instructions
- **Future**: From reusable operations and procedures, scheduled at specific work centers
